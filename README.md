# Sonic
Sonic is a Go library for network and I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model. Sonic currently supports only Unix based systems.

## Getting Started
See `examples/`. A good starting point is `examples/timer`. All examples can be built by calling `make` in the root path of sonic. The builds will be put in `bin/`.

For more information, see `docs/`.
